Minecraft: The Island by Max Brooks, #1 New York Times bestselling author of World War Z, is the first official Minecraft novel. In the tradition of iconic stories like Robinson Crusoe and Treasure Island, Minecraft: The Island will tell the story of a new hero stranded in the world of Minecraft, who must survive the harsh, unfamiliar environment and unravel the secrets of the island.

We loved this book so much that created a server. Already invited and added keralis, xisuma, zombiecleo, mumbojumbo, and waiting for a reply on the entire hermicraft clan. There is a limit on the server, but at least sabel, yvette, zahara, sybilla, marcus, tabbatha and tabby are already online and building.

Good luck everybody!
